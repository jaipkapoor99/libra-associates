### High-Level Plan: Building the Libra Associates Website

The goal is to create a professional, modern, and responsive website for Libra Associates. The site will establish their brand identity, showcase their services, and provide a clear way for potential clients to get in touch.

---

#### **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Structure**

1.  **Branding & UI Kit:**
    - Define a consistent color palette, typography, and spacing system within `tailwind.config.ts`.
    - Create a set of reusable UI components using `shadcn/ui`. Start with the essentials: `Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Label`, and navigation elements.

2.  **Layout & Routing:**
    - Install `react-router-dom` to handle client-side routing.
    - Create a main layout component (`components/Layout.tsx`) that includes a shared `Header` and `Footer`.
    - Set up the primary page routes:
      - `/` (Home)
      - `/about` (About Us)
      - `/services` (Our Services)
      - `/contact` (Contact Us)

#### **Phase 2: Page Content & Feature Development**

1.  **Homepage (`/`):**
    - **Hero Section:** A compelling headline, a brief introduction to Libra Associates, and a primary call-to-action (e.g., "Schedule a Consultation").
    - **Services Overview:** A summary of the key services offered, with links to the main Services page.
    - **"Why Us?" Section:** Highlight key differentiators and build trust.
    - **Testimonials:** Include quotes from satisfied clients.

2.  **Services Page (`/services`):**
    - Create a detailed breakdown of each service offered.
    - Use `Card` components to present each service in a structured and visually appealing way.

3.  **About Us Page (`/about`):**
    - Tell the story of Libra Associates: its mission, vision, and values.
    - Introduce the team members with photos and brief bios.

4.  **Contact Page (`/contact`):**
    - Implement a contact form using `shadcn/ui` components (`Input`, `Textarea`, `Button`).
    - Include other contact methods like an email address, phone number, and physical address if applicable.

#### **Phase 3: Interactivity & Polish**

1.  **Contact Form Logic:**
    - Add client-side validation using a library like `zod`.
    - Set up a backend service (e.g., a serverless function or a service like Formspree) to handle form submissions and send email notifications.

2.  **Animations & Transitions:**
    - Incorporate subtle animations and page transitions to enhance the user experience. `framer-motion` is a great library for this.

3.  **Responsiveness & Accessibility:**
    - Thoroughly test the website on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) and ensure it's fully responsive.
    - Ensure the site adheres to accessibility (a11y) best practices, which `shadcn/ui` helps facilitate.

#### **Phase 4: Deployment & Go-Live**

1.  **Optimization:**
    - Run the build process (`npm run build`) to create an optimized, production-ready version of the site.
    - Review and optimize asset sizes (images, etc.).

2.  **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the static assets to a modern hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify, which offer seamless integration with Vite projects.

3.  **Final Touches:**
    - Set up SEO basics (meta titles, descriptions).
    - Integrate web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible) to track site traffic.
