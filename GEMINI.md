## **Phase 1: Interactivity & Polish**

1. **Animations & Transitions:**
    - Incorporate subtle animations and page transitions to enhance the user experience. `framer-motion` is a great library for this.

2. **Responsiveness & Accessibility:**
    - Thoroughly test the website on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) and ensure it's fully responsive.
    - Ensure the site adheres to accessibility (a11y) best practices, which `shadcn` helps facilitate.

## **Phase 2: Deployment & Go-Live**

1. **Optimization:**
    - Run the build process (`npm run build`) to create an optimized, production-ready version of the site.
    - Review and optimize asset sizes (images, etc.).

2. **Final Touches:**
    - Set up SEO basics (meta titles, descriptions).
    - Integrate web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible) to track site traffic.
